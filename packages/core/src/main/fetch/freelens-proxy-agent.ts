 * A dispatcher that trusts the self-signed freelens-proxy certificate.
 *
 * undici pools sockets per dispatcher, so — unlike the `https.Agent` this
 * replaces — a fresh one per request would leak connections. The certificate is
 * generated once per process, so one dispatcher per certificate is enough.
 *
 * Main negotiates HTTP/2 with freelens-proxy on purpose, as undici does by default:
 * the renderer does too, so every client of the server takes the same protocol
 * path. undici sends the `Host` header of a request as `:authority`, which is
 * what freelens-proxy routes on over HTTP/2.
