# Freelens

## The Repository

Freelens is a standalone application for MacOS, Windows, and Linux operating
systems.

This repository is a fork of [Open Lens](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/tree/master), core of [Lens Desktop](https://k8slens.dev), with the aim of carrying forward its open source version.

## Downloads

The official packages have not yet been released. You can track the progress
of the [milestone
0.1.1](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/milestone/1).

However, you can download testing packages from the project for nightly
builds: <https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens-nightly-builds/releases>

### Windows

The EXE and MSI packages are not yet signed then you must override Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen to install them.

Only x64 (amd64) version of the Windows binaries are provided.

### AppImage

Linux AppImage file requires `libz.so` and `libfuse.so.2`. You can add them,
ie. by running:

```sh
sudo ln -fs /usr/lib/*/libz.so.1 /usr/local/lib/libz.so
sudo ldconfig
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

Run the application with additional arguments:

```sh
./Freelens*.AppImage --no-sandbox --ozone-platform-hint=auto
```

### Node-Pod-Menu extension

To view container logs and shell into them and nodes you can install the very
useful extension
[freelens-node-pod-menu](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens-node-pod-menu)

its functionality and fix bugs.
